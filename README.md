# MICROSOFT STOCK ANALAYSIS

Performed exploratory data analysis on Microsoft’s historical stock data to identify trends, detect outliers, and examine correlations among features.
Engineered features and trained a Linear Regression model to predict stock closing prices, achieving strong results (R² = 0.99, MSE = 0.83).
Visualized stock behavior over time and used heatmaps and scatter plots to derive actionable insights on market movement and feature relationships.
